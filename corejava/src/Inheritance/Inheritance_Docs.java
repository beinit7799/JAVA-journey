 * -------------------------------Inheritance--------------------------------
 * # Used for code re-usability.
 * # Process of accessing properties and method of parent/super/base class to 
 * 	 child/sub/derived class is known as inheritance.
 * # Also known as IS-A relationship.
 * # Its a generalization to specialization process.
 * # We can't inherit private properties,method and constructors.
 * # We can inherit only one class at a time.
 * # Multiple inheritance not exist in java with class.
 * 
 * 		=>Syntax:-
 * 			
 * 			child_class extends parents_class(){
 * 				
 * 				//properties
 * 				//methods
 * 
 * 				class A(){ 
 * 
 *				}  
 *					
 *				class B extends A(){ 
 * 
 *				}
 *					
 *				  class C extends B(){ 
 *
